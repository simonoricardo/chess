# Chess

A naive implementation of a Chess game / engine / etc.
Not sure yet what this is going to be exactly.

The goal is to experiment with different data structure and algorithms,
while leveraging the real time aspects of Elixir/Erlang and OTP.

There may or may not be an AI at some point to play against.
This README will be updated once this project is deployed somewhere
